# Order-Sensitive-Imputation
Order-Sensitive Imputation for Clustered Missing Values

## Idea:
This is a code implementation of the idea proposed by a group of researchers in their research paper titled "Order-Sensitive Imputation for Clustered Missing Values". This is just a try
to workout the math and to translate the method proposed in the paper into a python based code. This was only intended to be carried out for educational and for improving my coding standards
and proficiency.
